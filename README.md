## Projects

## [Retinal Disorder Classification Using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Images:](https://github.com/AbdullahRagheb/retinal-disorders-detection)

- Categorize patients into four classes: CNV, DME, Drusen, and Normal using OCT images.
- Leverage transfer learning techniques (VGG16 and Inception V3 Net) for accurate classification.
- Achieve high accuracy, surpassing traditional methods and even human experts in some cases.

## [AI Language Translation System:](https://github.com/AbdullahRagheb/Google_translate_codealpha)

- Developed a Python-based AI-powered language translation tool using NLP techniques and machine learning models.
- Implemented the solution with PyTorch, integrating it into a Flask-based web application for real-time translation.

## [Big Data Analysis & Machine Learning (PySpark):](https://github.com/AbdullahRagheb/ML-anaylsis-for-Big-Data)

- Conducted data analysis and machine learning on large datasets using PySpark.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to predict trends and patterns in big data, optimizing processes for a variety of industries.

## Real Estate Price Prediction Tool (Egypt):
- Created a machine learning model to predict apartment prices in Egypt based on features such as area size, location, and amenities.
- The model was built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, with a Flask web interface for user interaction.
